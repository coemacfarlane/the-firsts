          A lively, behind-the-scenes look at the historic cohort of diverse,
          young, and groundbreaking women newly elected to the House of
          Representatives in 2018 as they arrive in Washington, D.C., and start
          working for change, by a New York Times reporter with sharp insight
          and deep knowledge of the Hill.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In November 2018, the greatest number of women in American history
          entered Congress. From Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and “the Squad” to
          “the Badasses” with national security backgrounds, from the first two
          Native Americans in Congress to the first two Muslim women, all were
          swept into office on a wave of grassroots support, diverse in
          background, age, professional experience, and ideology.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In The Firsts, New York Times reporter Jennifer Steinhauer follows
          these women’s first year in the 116th Congress, chronicling their
          transition from running trailblazing campaigns to the daily work of
          governance. In committee rooms, offices, and conversations on the run
          through the halls of the Capitol, she probed the question: Would
          Washington, with its hidebound traditions, change the changemakers, or
          would this Congress, which looked a little more like today’s America,
          truly be the start of something new?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Vivid and smart, The Firsts delivers fresh details, inside access,
          historical perspective, and expert analysis as these women—inspiring,
          controversial, talented, and rebellious—do something truly surprising:
          make Congress essential again.
